This project would not have started or finished without Andreas Heinz, who both suggested the topic and provided support and supervision throughout this project.

The \prgname{Talys} simulations, which were used to partially compare the output of the code, would obviously not have been possible without the \prgname{Talys} team. In particular, I am indepted to Arjan Koning for being helpful over mail, providing me with the latest version of \prgname{Talys}, and for adding a \prgname{Talys} keyword that enabled me to do the comparison between the emission spectra of my program and \prgname{Talys}.

Also good at alleviating technology related pain is HÃ¥kan Johansson, who (mostly) has kept the computers at the subatomic physics group happy.

On the few occasions when the computers weren't happy, I could usually blame Simon Lindberg, who -- in addition to tormenting the intranet -- inspired me to have a look at gamma-multiplicites and explained the addback routine used to analyze the energy deposits in the Crystal Ball detector.

Last but not least, I would like to thank the entire subatomic physics group for bearing with me and making me feel welcome -- and the University for all the cake.
