This project was realised thanks to the help and support from a few, but important, people.

We would first like to thank our supervisors: Andreas Heinz, whose enthusiasm and guidance kept us going to the very end. HÃ¥kan Johansson, who acted as tech support and advisor, at any time of the day. And last but not least, Ronja Thies, for going to lengths to find out what no one else seemed to know.
 
We would also like to thank Sven Eriksson, for proof-reading our report and for providing the point of view of a fellow student.

Finally, we would like to thank all of those who have contributed to the various software products employed during this project.
