This thesis describes Monte-Carlo simulations of the \emph{S393} light exotic-ion beam experiment that was carried out at GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, using the simulation software \prgname{Geant4} via the wrapper program \prgname{ggland}. Specifically, it focuses on the fragment arm of the detector setup in Cave C and the ability of the \prgname{Ralf's Tracker} software to track and identify simulated ions. 

Two separate cases are considered. Firstly, the trackers ability to identify particles ejected forward along the beam-axis with incorrect information of the magnetic field in ALADiN (A LArge DIpole magNet). Secondly, the trackers ability to identify particles ejected with an angle $\alpha$ from the beam-axis is studied. The simulations were carried out by firing single, neutron rich $4 \le Z\le 9$ nuclei with a magnetic rigidity of \unit[8.8]{Tm} from the target location, corresponding to particles bending off along the fragment arm at a $15^{\circ}$ deflection angle. 

It is found that the tracker, calibrated in accordance with a predescribed routine\footnote{\label{foot:calibinstruct}\url{http://ralfplag.de/tracker/calibration/} (19-05-2013)}, is able to correct for the incorrect magnetic field by effectively rotating the fragment arm for the cases simulated. The resulting errors are small enough as not to affect identification of the simulated ions. The tracker is also able to identify most particles fired at an angle $\alpha$ as long as all detectors along the trajectory are hit. The size of the GFIs (Gro\ss{}er FIber detektor) is the first limiting factor for detecting particles with $\alpha\gtrsim 2.5^{\circ}$. However, some non-geometric effects cause some particles to miss the TFW (Time of Flight Wall) at roughly the same angle. These effects remain unidentified. 

In addition, the geometry of detectors defined in \prgname{ggland} together with algebraic approximations for, in the simulations, choosing an appropriate magnetic rigidity for a given ALADiN current and for determining the charge of particles, given the energy deposits in the TFW, are presented in appendices.
