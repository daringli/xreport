As a first qualitative test to the code, we consider the decay of a wide range of nuclei, from $(Z,N)=(10,10)$ to $(90,130)$.
A list of all elible nuclei was generated by \prgname{nuclist}, for 4 different exciation energies, $E*=\unit[5, 10, 15, 20]{MeV}$. The most likely decay channel of these nuclei were then calculated with \prgname{spectra}.

The results, which were run though an octave script to plot each nuclei on a chart, is presented in \autoref{fg:chart1}.
