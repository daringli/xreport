\section{codex\_particle\_model}

\begin{lstlisting}
void Codex_particle_model::Rsum(Nucleus n, int jmax,int lmax,std::vector<std::pair<double,Decay> > & Rsum_decay,  int & counter) const
\end{lstlisting}
This function sums up $R=\frac{d^2 P}{dt dE_f^*}$ for the decay modes accounted for in \texttt{codex\_particle\_model}.
It first sums $l$ from zero to $l_\text{max}$, than $S=|J_i-l|,\dots , |J_i+l|$ and finally $J_f =|S-s|,\dots , |S+s|$. The only calculation performed in the two inner loops is counting the number of times specific $J_f$ values occur, which gives the number of ways to couple the relevant angular momenta to end up in $J=J_f$.
A second loop nested in the $l$-loop goes from $E_f^*=0$ to $E_f^* = E_f^* - S_\nu$ with an increment of $dE$ during each loop. In this loop, $T_l(E)$ is calculated once, and all the found $J_f$ values are looped over in order to calculate $\rho(E_f^*,J_f)$ exactly once.
